# Pyramid
A Python script to generate Graphviz dot format data and SVG call graph from RTL intermediate representation of gcc. 

## Why is it called Pyramid?
Thanks to brilliant idea from [Egypt](https://www.gson.org/egypt/egypt.html), the name *Pyramid* implies where the idea itself comes from. In the other hand this **Py**ramid and **Py**thon both start with the same prefix. That is why it is called Pyramid. The following snippet shows how the name Egypt comes.

```python
print([chr(ord(c) + 13) if chr(ord(c) + 13) <= 'z' else chr(ord(c) + 13 - 26) for c in 'rtlcg'])
```

## Prerequisite
pip install pydotplus

## Usage
- Make sure that input RTL(Register Transfer Language) files generated by the compiler are prepared 
```
make clean && make CFLAGS=-fdump-rtl-expand
```
- Run the script
```
./pyramid.py [-o callgraph.svg] [--omit 'some_function1, some_function2'] <rtl-file-list>
```
- Open the output SVG file with your Chrome browser
