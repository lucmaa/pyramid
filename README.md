# Pyramid
rewrite Egypt in python

## Why is it called Pyramid?
Thanks to brilliant idea from [Egypt](https://www.gson.org/egypt/egypt.html), the name *Pyramid* implies where the idea itself comes from. In the other hand this **Py**ramid and **Py**thon both start with the same prefix. That is why it is called Pyramid. The following snippet shows how the name Egypt comes.

```python
print([chr(ord(c) + 13) if chr(ord(c) + 13) <= 'z' else chr(ord(c) + 13 - 26) for c in 'rtlcg'])
```
